In this thesis we present our approach to constructing an ultra low-cost flowcell biosensor which is capable of determining changes in index of refraction on the order of $10^{-5}$. Our sensor utilizes 3D printed parts a one dimensional photonic crystal coupled to a prism rather than the traditional SPR metal film prism coupling system. By using this method we are able to bring the cost of manufacturing the sensor to around $\$100$, excluding the photonic crystals which can be fabricated commercially. The largest cost of the system is a USB camera which is used to collect data.\\
