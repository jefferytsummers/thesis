The process of design for this experiment relies heavily on the use of a 15 milimeter right prism and our photonic crystal. The photonic crystal is composed of 3 bilayers of TiO2 and SiO2. The dielectric function of TiO2 is taken as $\epsilon_{TiO2} = 4.84 + 0.0007i$ and the dielectric function of SiO2 is taken as $\epsilon_{SiO2} = 2.1316 + 0.0001i$. 


It should be noted that the imaginary parts of each dielectric function may not be accurate and have been included to introduce some form of loss that fits the results of prior experiments. Figure 3 illustrates the structure of the multilayer.
The basic design of the sensor is split into three different parts: the primary stage, two beams, and the flowcell stage.  One of the two beams holds our laser and a focusing lens while the other holds the CCD and captures the reflected beam. Normally the laser light is too intense to pick up the surface mode in the reflected image. However, we attach a neutral density (d=3.5, see Figure \ref{fig:beams}) filter to reduce the intensity and this allows us to image the surface mode.

Each beam is a 15cm x 10mm x 10mm aluminum MakerBeam. Attached on the left side of each beam in Figure \ref{fig:beams} is a foot used to keep the beams level with the central platform. On the right side of each beam is a 3D printed connector used to fasten the beams to the primary stage. The beams are capable of rotating around the axis that keeps these connectors in place, allowing a larger range of coupling angles for the laser-multilayer system.


The primary stage (see the green 3D printed fixture in Figure \ref{fig:centralstage}) acts as the center about which the incident beam can be coupled to the prism and then reflected onto the CCD. The design of this stage allows different types of multilayers to be used since the incident laser beam can be oriented at nearly any angle. The flowcell stage (see the blue 3D printed piece bolted into the primary stage in Figure \ref{fig:centralstage})is a modular piece that is attached to the primary stage with four bolts. The prism, multilayer, and flowcell chamber are all strapped together on this stage via 3D printed braces and hex screws. The modular nature of this piece of the sensor is very valuable since multiple designs can be used to achieve the same goal and it only takes about an hour to print off each flowcell stage. When the braces are tightened there is no liquid loss at the interface during operation, however the chamber is made of PLA and liquid will leak through the plastic after a few hours.

The glass prism, multilayer, and flowcell chamber are attached atop the flowcell stage with the use of hex screws and 3D printed braces.}

To flow liquids through the chamber the whole fixture must be water tight. To accomplish this we designed the flowcell so that a rubber gasket could be fit around the chamber.
